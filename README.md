### How betting lines work
If you're just getting started with sports betting, the most important thing you need to do is learn how the lines work. Because most games are mismatches, bookmakers use a point spread to balance out betting action on the two sides in order to achieve a "balanced book" or relatively equal dollars bet on each team. If this was not the case, everyone would just wager on the favorites to win, and bookies would be left to cover the difference.
