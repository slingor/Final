### How betting lines work
If you're just getting started with sports betting, the most important thing you need to do is learn how the lines work. Because most games are mismatches, bookmakers use a point spread to balance out betting action on the two sides in order to achieve a "balanced book" or relatively equal dollars wagered on each team. If this was not the case, everyone would just wager on the favorites to win, and bookies would be left to cover the difference. 

### Bookmaker Margins
The Juice, the Vig, the Margin, the Commission, The Take, The Percentage, The Cut. Whatever you want to call it, it's that slice of action every bookmaker takes out of the odds so as to make their business worth their while. Bookmakers generally attempt to get equal action on each side of the outcome that way no matter what outcome occurs they can take a profit.
